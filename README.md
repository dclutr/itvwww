Into the Virtual World with WebGL

Just a project where I tried to write the logic to drive a car using a keyboard

Main idea is that more time one presses w, the acceleration increases and on turning the accleration decreases

Got it to work kind of :P. yeah if you can call it working condition

Also have removed textures and effects I did not create making the project extra ugly
